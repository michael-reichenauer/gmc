## Branches Graph

The branches graph on the left side visualizes the selected
branches. More or less branches can be selected by using the
menus ('`M`', `RightArrow` or `LeftArrow`) or clicking in the
graph.

### Indicators for not Shown Branches

The cutoff gray '`┠╮`' and '`┠╯`' indicators right of a branch indicates
where, currently not shown branches, merge in or branch out
of the branch with left of these indicators.
Using the  `RightArrow` on such a commit line (or click) to
show the branches menu, will list the hidden branch and make
it easy show.
